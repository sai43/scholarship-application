== Scholarship Application

Project Explanation/Goal: As another practice project for Rails, this is a mock scholarship application to reinforce my knowledge of MVC web application architecture. Since this is mostly a backend learning project, creating fancy fancy views and styling will be my last step. Here will be some features by the end of the application:


Note: As an afterthought, naming a controller "applications" was a poor naming convention- if I were to do this again I would have chosen something along the line of "scholarships".

Users
Administrator
-A single admin can view all user profiles and scholarship applications, and edit what they please.

User
-Signed in users can only view their own scholarship application and can only submit one. They can also only view and edit their own profile
-After a user creates a new application, the admin will receive an e-mail that a new application was submitted.

Guest
-Anyone not signed in can view the static pages, but cannot view/edit/create etc. users or scholarship applications

Automatic testing

Gems That Will be Used (Tentativee):

devise: User Authentication
cancan: User Abilities
jquery-ui-rails: Autocomplete for Universities and States in Scholarship Applications
rspec: testing

To Do List as of 5/24: Fix user authorization


More to come.
